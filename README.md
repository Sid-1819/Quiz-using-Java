Features
OOP principles: Utilizes classes and objects to represent questions, answers, and game logic.
User Interaction: Prompts user for input and displays quiz questions and feedback.
Scoring System: Awards points for correct answers and keeps track of total score.
Running the Application
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Java installed and configured on your system. You can verify this by running java -version in your terminal.
Compiling: Compile the Java source files using a compiler like javac. You can navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run javac *.java to compile all files.
Running: Run the compiled program using the java command followed by the main class name. For example, if the main class is QuizApp, run java QuizApp in your terminal.
Gameplay
The program will greet you and display instructions. You will be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions. Enter the letter corresponding to your chosen answer. The program will inform you if your answer is correct and update your score.
